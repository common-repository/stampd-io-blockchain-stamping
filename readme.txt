== Description ==

This plugin allows you to stamp the contents of your posts to the blockchain. Protect the authenticity of your original work by timestamping the unique identifier (SHA256 hash) of each posts's content.

Using this plugin you can stamp your posts and add a custom signature with the resulting hash and transaction ID.
